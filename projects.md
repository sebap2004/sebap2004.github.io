# Projects I'm Working On 
Here are some projects that I have worked on or am working on currently.

Fistblitz is a platform fighter project that I am currently working on as a hobby. My main focus, apart from university, is on this project. Be sure to follow the github page for updates!

For my final year software project, I am making an AI chatbot frontend as part of a group project.

[**Final Year Dissertation Project**](https://project.sebaprenovost.com/)\
For my final year dissertation project, I am making a piece of software that facilitates easy communication between students and teachers, hopefully bridging the gap of awkwardness and allowing people to feel more comfortable asking for help and engaging in class
